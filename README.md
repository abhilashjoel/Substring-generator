# Substring-generator

This program is written in C.

This code will generate a list of valid substrings from an input string.

We assume that the file with the wordlist is stored as 'dict.txt' in the same directory as the source code(the zip file contains this).

This program will initially read all the words from the wordlist file and create a linked-list based representation of its contents. 
This representation significantly increases the efficiency of the code.

**due to some coding constraints in c, we have inserted the pattern 'zzzzzz' as the last line of the wordlist file to indicate the 'end of file.
